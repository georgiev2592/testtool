2.3.2.  Searching for a Test
</h4>
</a>
<p>
This introductory scenario shows the user how to search for a test.  From the test bank, the user may choose key words to narrow the search and look for a particular test either by the key words or by the date published.

After clicking on <q>Test Manager</q> on the menu page, it will bring the user to the management page as shown in Figure 1.

<br>
From the Test Manager, one may search for a test by using the search bar at the top of the page.  Simply type in a keyword that is contained in the name of the test or in the test itself.  A window will pop up containing any results that match the criteria specified in the search bar as shown in Figure 2.

<p>
Tests are displayed by the date they are created, so if the user wishes to search for a certain test, they may use the publish date as an additional resource to locate the desired test.

</a>
<br>

From the results window, a drop down menu is available which presents the users with options with which they may view or edit the selected test.  The user may also re-enter keywords or remove keywords to start a new search.

<p>
By clicking on the dropdown menu, the user may select to either delete tests or edit a previously existing test as shown in Figure 3.  

<p>
To see what options there are when editing or deleting a test, see <a href="tm-manage-tests.html">Section 2.3.3</a>.
