<p>
Testmoz is a simple online tool for creating and distributing digital tests. Most of the features of the tool are free, but more for more comprehensive test management features (such as a way to display all authored tests in one place) users must pay a $20.00/year fee.

Testmoz provides an acceptable level of testing tool functionality, but it missing a few key features, most notably the question bank of our TestTool design.
