Peter Georgiev Code Review of Tim Yung
</h4>
</a>

<strong>Class: DeleteQuestionUI.java</strong>: 
GUI is working and functional. Maybe not a good idea to ask the user to enter the Question ID in order to delete the question because the user won't know it.
<br>
<strong>Method: DeleteQuestionUI.jTextField1ActionPerformed</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>
		Add implementation to the method.
	<li>
		Change method name to something meanningful.
</ul>  
<br>
<strong>Method: DeleteQuestionUI.jButton1ActionPerformed</strong>:  
<ul>
	<li>
		Add implementation to the method.
	<li>
		Change method name to something meanningful.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Class: CourseOffering.java</strong>: 
Basic implementation of the class looks good. 
<br>
Note: CourseOffering.java is part of package testtool.model.database therefore there is no need to import all the classes from that same package. What I mean is, you can delete 
<br>
<pre>line 8: import testtool.model.database.*;</pre>
<br>
<strong>Method: CourseOffering.enrollStudent</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>
		Basic implementation is done.
	<li>
		Add implementation to the method.
</ul>  
<br>
<strong>Method: CourseOffering.dropStudent</strong>:  
<ul>
	<li>
		Basic implementation is done.
	<li>
		Add implementation to the method.
</ul>  
<br>
<strong>Method: CourseOffering.addTest</strong>:  
<ul>
	<li>
		Basic implementation is done.
	<li>
		Add implementation to the method.
</ul>  
<br>
<strong>Method: CourseOffering.removeTest</strong>:  
<ul>
	<li>
		Basic implementation is done.
	<li>
		Add implementation to the method.
</ul>  
<br>
General Note: After the actual implementation is done, it may be a good idea to add a print statement af the end af the method as well for debugging purposes.
<br>
Note regarding addTest and removeTest methods: I don't think those method are needed in this class becase TestManager.java takes case of adding and deleting tests.
