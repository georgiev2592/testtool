<h4>
2.2.2.2.  Delete Questions
</h4>
</a>
<p>
The scenario in this section illustrates an individual user (teacher) deleting selected questions from the question bank. For simplicity this scenario continues where the <a href = "images/question_search_result.png"><q>Search for Questions</q></a> scenario left off.
</p><p>
Each question in the question list has a checkbox at the left-side of its listing.
</p><p>
The user clicks on the checkboxes attached to two question listings. The system responds by selecting the question listings, visually indicated by marking the checkboxes and highlighting the listings.

<hr>
</a>

<p>
When a question is selected, two buttons appear at the top of the screen: one labeled 'Delete', and the other labeled 'Export'.
</p><p>
The user clicks on the 'Delete' button. The system responds by displaying a prompt, shown in the figure below.

<hr>
</a>

<p>
The dialog displays two buttons: one labeled 'Delete' the other labled 'Cancel'. If the user were to click on the 'Cancel' button, the prompt closes and the previous dialog <a href = "images/question_select_multiple.png">(Figure 0)</a> is displayed.
</p><p>
Instead, the user clicks on the 'Delete' button. The system responds by removing the selected questions from the question bank.

<p>
The prompt has been closed and the question listings associated with the deleted questions have been removed from the question list.
