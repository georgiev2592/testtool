This menu shows the percentage of users that were assigned the test that already took it as well as the exact amount. <br>
This menu also shows the percentage and amount of questions that have already been graded out of the total amount of questions.<br>
This menu also shows the average percentage score out of the graded questions of all students. For example if two students were assigned the test and one student has only 1 question graded out of 10 and got all the points for that question while the other is fully graded with all possible points, the average would be 100% because both students have 100% of graded points. <br>
