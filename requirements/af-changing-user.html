2.6.1.3 Editing a User
</h4>
</a>

<p>
This scenario describes how an administrator changes the permissions of a user. Administrators may change a User's privilege, either changing a User's permissions, or adding different details to the User so they have access to different courses.

<p>
By changing the permissions of a user, the user has access to different areas of the test tool.  For example, a student may only take tests and view grades, which a user with teacher level permissions may also create questions and create tests.

<p>
As seen in Figure 1, adminstrators change the permissions of user after clicking on the options drop down and selecting "edit," which can be seen in <a href = "af-user-database.html">Section 2.6.1</a>.  A popup window, with the permissions appears and the administrator has the option of changing the user to four different permissions: student, teacher, grader, or administrator.

<p>
Administrators can set multiple permissions on one user, meaning that a user can be a grader and a student for example, or a teacher and administrator, which is shown in Figure 2.

<p>
By having multiple permissions, a user has access to multiple areas of the test tool (i.e. a user with both teacher and administrator permissions has access to all features of both).  This feature essentially allows students to be a teacher's assistant to a class, or for teachers to also grade their own tests.

<p>
The administrator clicks on the "ok" button at the bottom of the window to finalize any changes, or clicks "cancel" to decline any changes that are made to the user.
