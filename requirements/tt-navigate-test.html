2.4.3. Navigate Test
</h4>
</a>
<p>
The scenario in this section illustrates the different ways a user can navigate between pages of a test.
This scenario continues where the previous scenario <a href = "images/take_test_p1_B.png">left off</a>.
</p><p>
At the bottom of the screen is a collection of buttons labelled with numbers, with arrows to the left and right.
These items are used to navigate between pages of the test view.
</p><p>
The user clicks on the right-facing arrow. The system responds by displaying the next page of test questions.

<p>
Each of the numbered buttons at the bottom of the screen links to a different page of the test. 
The buttons are also color-coded, to signify the user's progress through the test.
</p><p>
The '2' button is colored yellow, to signify that it is the currently active page of the test. 
<br>
The '1' button is colored red, to signify that the page it links to has unanswered questions.
<br>
The other buttons are colored white, to signify that linked pages have yet to be visited.
<br>
A green color (not pictured) indicates that all questions on the linked page have been responded to.
</p><p>
The user continues to navigate between pages by clicking on both the buttons and the two arrows, answering questions until they reach the last page of the test.
