1.4.  Impacts
</h3>

<p>
The positive, potential impacts of the Testing Tool as a functioning system are as follows:

<ol type = a>
<p> <li>
a test tool that incorporates all necessary components to efficiently create a functional computer science test as well as tests for other subjects.

<p> <li>
provides students to take tests as in-class proctored, take-home, or practice.

<p> <li>
allows students to immediately see grades so that they know what they can improve upon.
</ol>

The positive, potential impacts of the Testing Tool as a course example are as follows:

<ol type = a>
<p> <li>
provides a functional example of a piece of software with a specific purporse that others can use as a learning tool and a guide for their own software endeavors.
<p> <li>
exemplifies the result of group cooperation, following the protocols of a formal method.
</ol>

<p>
There are a few potential, negative impacts that may affect usability.  If the user interface is not appealing, or is too convoluted then users will feel less inclined to use the software.  Also, if the system for the user login is implemented incorrectly, private information may be leaked.  It is also important to be able to keep the answers to the questions private -- if the question bank is incorrectly implemented then users may be able to find the answers which would invalidate the test.

<p>
The Testing Tool, as a course example, has only one potential negative impact -- using a weak development methodology.  Under such conditions, software which is lacking proper development will reflect the poor circumstances, resulting in unrefined software.  However, this mistake can be avoided if proper care is taken beforehand not to use a particular methodology, either through care examination or experience.
