<h3>
1.1.  Problem Statement
</h3>
</a>
<p>
<p>The general problems to be addressed by the Testing Tool project are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>to ease teachers in the process of test making as well as help in the time-consuming grading of these tests</li>
<li>to provide a database of all test questions used in our tool to aid all teachers using our tool in creating the most diverse and comprehensive tests</li>
</ol>
<p>While these problems have been addressed by several other available products, the Testing Tool provides a solution with major improvements over existing tools. Specific areas of focus are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>creating a new, efficient way to test computer science majors</li>
<li>compiling all test questions for anyone to use</li>
<li>easily generate tests from existing teachers teaching the same class</li>
</ol>
<p>The Testing Tool project addresses the requirements of a particular customer. This customer needs a tool with a certain specification not available in any other tool. This issue is now been addressed and the challenge will be to combine existing features with that of the new features not yet implemented in any other product.</p></font></strong></em>
