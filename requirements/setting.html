1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>
<p>

There are two operational settings for the Testing Tool: (1) normal use as a functioning software system; (2) use as an example in software engineering courses.

<p>
The Testing Tool is intended to be general public domain software. As such, there is no specific operational setting in which it must be installed. The main setting the tool is designed for is the class room and more specifically the CS dept of Cal Poly. Although it will be suited for any testing enviroment.
</p>
<p>
As noted in the preceding section on system personnel, there are several end users for the Testing Tool. The main one is the teacher and thus the tool's requirements reflect the point of view of the teacher and are made to try to assist the teacher in running the class.
</p>
<p>
Before the Testing Tool, a teacher would need to use a text editor to copy and paste questions from previous exams together and then print them out to distribute them by hand. After the students finish the test the teacher would have to grade them by hand. With the Testing tool the teacher only needs to worry about creating questions and grading everything that cannot be automated. This takes away the strain of the logisitics of testing as well as streamlining the whole process.
</p>
<p>
For use as a pedagogical example, the Testing Tool has been designed to fit the curriculum used by Gene Fisher in undergraduate software engineering courses at Cal Poly University. These courses are one-quarter group projects that cover standard aspects of software engineering, with emphasis on the practical application of formal methods. For the most part, the concepts covered in these courses, and hence the concepts embodied in the Testing Tool, are mainstream software engineering. Other instructors may therefore find the Testing Tool and its development artifacts useful as course examples.
