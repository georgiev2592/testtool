End users are those who use the Test Tool for its intended purpose. Teachers are the primary registered users and can access all of the Test Tool features including managing the question bank, automatic test generation, managing student grades, and taking practice exams. Students are registered users who are able to take tests created by teachers and also view the grades they receive for them. Graders are registered users given permissions to edit graded tests for specific classes or groups of students. System administrators perform overall system administration functions, the most notable of which is user registration. Finally, anyone else is able to use the Test Tool as a unregistered student in order to take practice tests created by teachers.

The primary customer is Gene Fisher. He is customer representative for his faculty and staff colleagues in the Computer Science department at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. In this representative capacity, Fisher will consult with other potential customers to gather requirements from them, and integrate their requirements with his own.
</p><p>
Apart from its use as a practical tool for Computer Science deptartment faculty, the Test Tool is intended to serve as an example for use in software engineering courses. The students who use the Test Tool for this purpose focus on the artifacts of its development rather than its use as a functioning tool.
