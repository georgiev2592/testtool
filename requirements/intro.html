 This document defines requirements for an electronic Test Tool. The tool provides functions to generate tests from user provided questions as well as assign tests to specific users to be taken and graded. Instructors use the tool to create questions, generate exams, and grade completed exams that have been submitted by students. Students use the tool to electronically take exams assigned to them by instructors.

In addition to providing useful functionality, the Test Tool serves as a pedagogical example of software engineering concepts and principles. The software development artifacts for the Test Tool are considered part of the overall Test Tool package.
