<strong>Robert Mitsuda's Inspection Test
</strong>
</font>
</p>

<br>

<p>
I inspected Peter Georgiev's sections.  This inspection test is for Section 2.1.  For clarity's sake, I will consider each indent to be a whole new paragraph even if it is only one sentence.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><strong>Component</strong>
    <td valign=top><strong>Inspector</strong>

    <td valign=top>2.1
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>I thought you were going to put a description of what happened whenever you clicked one of the squares -- it was there roughly in your previous draft, but it is gone in this one.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.1P1
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>don't use "will, would, could, etc."
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.1I1
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>DONE
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.1P2
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>grammar error in the first sentence -- "provides users to have." You also mispelled "redirected" in the second sentence.  Fix grammar -- "to the one of the following..."
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.1I2
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>isn't it supposed to be grade manager? I think grade test is supposed to be in the Grade Manager.
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.1I3
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>DONE
    <td valign=top>&nbsp;

  <tr>

    <td valign=top>don't use "will" 
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.1P7
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>put commas and periods within the quotation marks and change "they" to he/she or change the singular "user" to "users."  Also don't use "will"
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>2.1P8
    <td valign=top>RM
    <td valign=top>19oct15
    <td valign=top>FIX
    <td valign=top>see previous comment for 2.1P7.  Also, try to make the second sentence flow better -- there are a lot of "ands" in the sentence.
