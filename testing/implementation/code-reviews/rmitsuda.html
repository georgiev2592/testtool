Robert Mitsuda Code Review of Peter Georgiev
</h4>
</a>

<strong>Class: CreateTestUI.java</strong>: 
GUI is good.  Everything is functional.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.ButtonCreateActionPerformed</strong>:  
Method works.  Change method name to something more appropriate.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.TextFieldTestNameActionPerformed</strong>:  
Blank method. can remove.
<br>
<br>
<br>




<strong>Class: DeleteTestUI.java</strong>: 
GUI is good.  Everything is functional.
<br>
<strong>Method: DeleteTestUI.ButtonSearchActionPerformed</strong>:  
blank method. can remove.
<br>
<strong>Method: DeleteTestUI.ButtonDeleteActionPerformed</strong>:  
method should work once full implementation is achieved.  looks good. but maybe rename to something more accurate.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Class: EditTestUI.java</strong>: 
GUI is good.  Everything is functional -- all the methods are blank right now.  Should work once implementation is fully completed.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Class: ManageTestsUI.java</strong>: 
GUI is good.  Everything is functional.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.ButtonCreateActionPerformed</strong>:  
Method works.  Change method name to something more appropriate.
<br>
<br>


<strong>Class: CreateTestUI.java</strong>: 
GUI is good.  Everything is functional. Rename the methods so that it is easier to understand what they're doing.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.SearchFieldActionPerformed</strong>:  
Method works.  Change method name to something more appropriate.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.TestTableMouseClicked</strong>:  
I don't think you need the last else statement or the middle else if, the else covers both scenarios.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.ButtonViewActionPerformed</strong>:  
Correctly switches panel. 
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.ButtonDeleteActionPerformed</strong>:  
This will delete a specified test once full implementation is complete, deleting a dummy test is okay for now.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.SearchButtonActionPerformed</strong>:  
Works perfectly after bug fix.
<br>
<strong>Method: CreateTestUI.AdvancedSearchButtonActionPerformed</strong>:  
Works as intended.
<br> 
<br>
<br>


<strong>Class: TestSearchUI.java</strong>: 
GUI is good.  Everything is functional.  Fix method names.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestSearchUI.ButtonClearActionPerformed</strong>:  
I think you can set the fields to null instead of using blank strings -- not entirely sure.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestSearchUI.ButtonCancelActionPerformed</strong>:  
Print statement not necessary since the window closes.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestSearchUI.ButtonSearchActionPerformed</strong>:  
Method works.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestSearchUI.close</strong>:  
Method works fine.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Class: Test.java</strong>: 
Simple class with lots of get-Methods.  All of them work fine. 
How does the date get initialized in the constructor?
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Class: TestManager.java</strong>: 
Spest comments look good.  Prints are probably not necessary.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestManager.createTest</strong>:  
Your comment says pass the ID instead of the User.  Just change that and should be good.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestManager.editTest</strong>:  
Not yet implemented.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestManager.deleteTest</strong>:  
Method works. everything good.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestManager.search</strong>:  
Method fine.  However, there are two search methods -- overloading this method might be a bit confusing, but otherwise it's fine.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestManager.publishTest</strong>:  
Not yet implemented.
<br>
<strong>Method: TestManager.getActiveTest</strong>:  
Method works fine.
<br>
