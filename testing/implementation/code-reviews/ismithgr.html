<strong>Class QuestionSearchUI</strong>:
<br>
 <em>
     I drew the menu initially. Changes to the code were made to fully implement with model classes and database. 
     This code was committed with errors, 20 minutes before the deadline to submit the milestone. I do not know who
     made the changes as multiple people have editted the file tonight (for some reason). It is currently
     11:57pm and I am still working on fixing the errors. Taking a break to do this because catharsis.

<strong>Method QuestionSearchUI.initComponents()<sub>1</sub></strong>:
<br>
  <em>
     This method should be generated entirely from the .form files created by netbeans. Two variable instatiations
     were added to this file: neither corresponding to our specification/model for the file, and both added errrors.
     I needed to edit the file outside of netbeans in order to remove the two lines. 
     <br>
     The main issue: the person who made the changes created new variables referencing our model and database. In our
     model, references to the model classes are passed to the view by their constructors. The same is true of the database
     classes, except that the model classes interract with them directly, and the view classes do not.

     I was unable to completely fix this method. The following is a list of the errors that I encounterred:
     <ul>
         <li>input fields are not checked for errors</li>
         <li>time is read in as String, rather than int</li>
         <li>type is read in as int, rather than QuestionType</li>
         <li>difficulty is read in as int, rather than QuestionDifficulty</li>
         <li>person attempted to instatiate enums (QuestionType and QuestionDifficulty)
               rather than grabbing them from the JComboBox via .getSelectedItem()</li>
         <li>person created a new Course, with course num and dept (two separate attributes) as part of the same String field,
               and garbage values otherwise</li>
         <li>same as above, but with User</li>
         <li>uses keywords to associated question listings in jtable to entries in question database; keywords are not unique,
             should use question id field</li>
     </ul>

The remaining methods were unchanged and therefore behave correctly :)
